# Rendering Meshes with OpenGL

Using C++ and OpenGL, this program allows for a user to insert a mesh model based on 3D human pose data.

## Camera Control

'o' / 'p' keys switch between orthographic and perspective
'a' / 'd' moves the camera on the x-axis directions
'q' / 'z' moves the camera on the y-axis directions
'w' / 's' moves the camera on the z-axis directions

Gaze always points towards the origin.
